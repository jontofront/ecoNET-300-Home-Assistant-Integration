# Testing Standards

## Test Framework
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use fixtures for common test data

## Test Structure
- Group tests by functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Mocking Guidelines
- Mock device API responses
- Use pytest-mock for mocking
- Create realistic test data
- Test different device types and models

## Coverage Requirements
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test all public interfaces
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Test configuration flows

## Test Data
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Create realistic device responses
- Test with different parameter combinations
- Validate error handling scenarios
